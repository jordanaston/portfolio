            <p>
              Throughout my life I’ve always been fascinated by technology and it’s possibilities. 
              In my past years I had a heavy focus in sound engineering and music production while 
              playing in a number of bands and working as a live sound engineer and DJ. I’ve always 
              been influenced by music and discovered my creative side through performance, live 
              production and mixing. I’m now pursuing a career in web development to explore a more 
              technical, yet creative side of myself I’ve always wanted to develop. <br><br>
              
              I currently work as a technical advisor for a company called Concentrix providing 
              support to software problems for iOS, MacOS and media services. In my previous role, 
              I worked as an audio technician for a company called Select AV which involved the setup 
              and live operations of audio and visual equipment for live events and functions. 
              My skills lay in problem solving and creativity which is why a career in web development 
              is so compelling to me.<br><br>

              I have an associate degree in audio engineering and am currently studying a diploma 
              of information technology at Coder Academy Brisbane. Looking forward to sharpening my 
              skills as a developer and start taking on real world projects as soon as possible!<br><br>
