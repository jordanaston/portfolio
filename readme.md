The purpose of building this website is to demonstrate my professional skills, work and study history and personal interests while showcasing an ability to design and develop various websites and applications. It will be used as a networking tool and give people the opportunity to inquire about work and collaborations via a submissions form. 

On this site you will be able to access my current works, blogs, about me and contact section via a nav-bar made up of links. The home section contains a short mission statement, the projects links, when clicked showcase completed works in a new tab, the history section is primarily text while the contact section includes a form for inquiries and links to my professional accounts, social media pages and resume which also open in a new tab. The name header on each page also works as a link to take you back to the home page. You can access a list of blogs through the blog link in the nav-bar. Each blog will be a detailed review of the process of learning and understanding common concepts of various programming languages. 

This website uses media queries to create a responsive layout for mobile, tablet and desktop views. It features a background created by myself in photoshop that rotates 90 degrees when switching between mobile and tablet/desktop view. It is designed to be as minimal as possible so the user can see understand the content quickly and clearly.
